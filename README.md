## Project Description

### The Apprentice Project (TAP)

In the rapidly evolving landscape of the 21st century, a comprehensive education is paramount for preparing students with the skills necessary to thrive in modern society. The Apprentice Project (TAP) is dedicated to cultivating these essential 21st-century skills among underserved children enrolled in government or low-income private schools.

TAP operates under the umbrella of the MentorMe Foundation, a Section 8 registered company, and is proudly supported by esteemed institutions such as Harvard University, IIM Bangalore, and the Nudge Foundation. As official partners with the Governments of Maharashtra and Delhi, TAP has a significant impact, reaching over 31,000 children through its innovative chatbot.

### Problem Statement

A staggering number of middle and high school students‚Äîover 100 million‚Äîfrom low-income communities across India lack critical 21st-century skills, including Social & Emotional Learning (SEL) and Financial Literacy. The traditional exam-centric public education system exacerbates this issue, leading to the alarming statistic that 1 in 2 children graduating from the Indian education system is deemed unemployable due to the absence of these crucial skills.

- **Financial Literacy Statistics:**
  - Only 16.7% of Indian teenage students possess basic financial literacy.
  - A mere 27% of the Indian adult population is considered financially literate.

### UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)

TAP aligns its mission with several UN SDGs:

- **Goal 1:** No Poverty
- **Goal 2:** Zero Hunger
- **Goal 3:** Good Health and Well-being
- **Goal 4:** Quality Education
- **Goal 8:** Decent Work and Economic Growth

### Current System

The Apprentice Project (TAP), operating under the MentorMe Foundation, empowers underserved students through TAP Buddy‚Äîan artificial intelligence-powered WhatsApp chatbot. TAP Buddy offers video-based electives, guiding students through independent projects using personalized (ML-learned) and AI bot-based nudges and content. Self-learning project videos foster skills such as creativity, confidence, self-awareness, communication, and problem-solving, breaking mental barriers and instilling a growth mindset.

### Challenges and Innovations

As the usage of TAP's chatbot continues to grow, the project faces challenges and seeks innovative solutions:

1. **Course Creation:** Leveraging AI to generate content across various electives such as coding and visual arts, aiming to overcome limitations in bulk video creation due to manual time constraints.

2. **Personalized Learning:** Employing AI to create personalized coding tutorials or art project guides tailored to individual learning styles and skill levels. Advanced ML/Open AI analysis adapts content based on a learner's progress, ensuring a customized learning experience.

3. **Content Creation:** Utilizing AI to generate code snippets, templates, or design ideas for art projects, guiding students at their skill levels and suggesting exploration options.

4. **Artistic Exploration:** Recommending techniques and styles based on a child's skill level, broadening artistic horizons by comparing their work to famous artists or art movements.

5. **Creative Coding:** Using AI to brainstorm ideas and provide inspiration for innovative and artistic coding projects.

## Approach and Solution

My approach to addressing the challenges faced by TAP involves leveraging cutting-edge technologies, including natural language processing (NLP), artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning (ML), to develop AutoTalker‚Äîa component of TAP aimed at enhancing the educational experience for students.

AutoTalker utilizes advanced AI models and libraries, such as Suno Bark TTS for text-to-speech conversion, Google's generative AI Python SDK (Gemini Pro) for text generation, and SadTalker for lip-syncing audio with facial movements in videos. By integrating these technologies, AutoTalker enables the creation of engaging and informative video content from text prompts and images.

Furthermore, the project incorporates features like personalized learning, content creation assistance, and language support to cater to diverse learning needs and preferences. By harnessing the power of AI, AutoTalker empowers educators and students alike to access high-quality educational content tailored to their individual requirements, thereby fostering the development of essential 21st-century skills.

Through this innovative solution, TAP aims to revolutionize the education landscape, bridging the gap in access to quality learning resources and empowering students from underserved communities to realize their full potential in the digital age.
